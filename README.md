# JavaScript PROJECT: Ech-A-Sketch
## About
In this project, I created a pretty neat toy for my portfolio to flex my DOM manipulation skills. I built a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.<br>

Requirements
1. Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
2. Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
3. Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.
4. (Optional): Instead of just changing the color of a square from black to white (for example), have each pass through with the mouse change it to a completely random RGB value.
